# SmartShelf Deployment

This is the B-1 deployment runbook for the current Vite app.

## Decision

- Provider: Vercel.
- Release source: `main`.
- Build command: `npm run build`.
- Install command: `npm ci`.
- Output directory: `dist`.
- Access protection: Vercel Routing Middleware with HTTP Basic Auth.
- Production deploy command: `vercel deploy --prod`.
- Rollback command: `vercel rollback <deployment-url-or-id>`.

Vercel was chosen because this repository is a static Vite app, the Vercel CLI is already available
on the deployment machine, and Vercel supports Vite builds, SPA rewrites, environment variables,
HTTPS, deployment URLs, and rollbacks.

## Required Vercel Environment Variables

Set these in Vercel before any preview or production deployment:

| Name | Environment | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BASIC_AUTH_USER` | Preview and Production | Login username for the pilot URL. |
| `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` | Preview and Production | Login password for the pilot URL. |
| `VITE_LLM_PROXY_URL` | Optional | HTTPS URL for the deployed LLM proxy. Leave unset to use rule-based explanations. |

The middleware fails closed: if either Basic Auth variable is absent, every request returns HTTP 503
instead of serving store data publicly.

Do not commit passwords, API keys, cookies, Vercel project metadata, `.env`, `.env.local`,
service-account files, or `.vercel/`.

## Data Refresh

The committed bundle already contains the real YomYom product catalog in `src/data/demoProducts.js`.
That is enough for the deployed app to show real product names, categories, prices, and inventory.

The daily operational export lives at `public/data/operational.json`.

**Decision: option 1 — the generated `public/data/*.json` files are committed.** Option 2 is not
available: Vercel's build image has no Python, no pyarrow, and no `data/**` parquet (all gitignored),
so it cannot regenerate the JSON. Option 3 waits on B-2/B-6. Committing the artifact is what makes a
clean Vercel build produce a working site, and `nagham.md` B-1 is explicit that the pilot cannot
depend on someone's laptop.

The committed export is real, regenerated from the committed `yomyom-inventory.csv`: **2,183
recommendations** — 1,147 `CHECK_WOLT_PRICE_GAP`, 625 `CHECK_NEGATIVE_STOCK`, 307
`VERIFY_UNKNOWN_BARCODE`, 104 `CHECK_MARGIN` — across 7,674 POS products.

To refresh it for a release:

```bash
python3 scripts/import_yomyom_pos.py --input yomyom-inventory.csv   # POS CSV → silver parquet
npm run data:dashboard                                              # → public/data/*.json
git add public/data/operational.json public/data/sources.json
git commit -m "data: refresh operational export"
git push                                                            # Vercel redeploys
```

`vercel.json` serves `/data/*` with `Cache-Control: no-store`, so a redeploy is picked up
immediately rather than serving a manager yesterday's actions.

Do not implement the runtime-fetch split from Issue #24 as part of B-1.

## Verification Checklist

Before promoting a production deployment:

- `npm ci`
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:py`
- `npm run test:pipeline`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `git diff --check`
- `vercel deploy --dry`
- `vercel deploy --prod`

After deployment:

- Unauthenticated request returns `401` when auth is configured.
- Missing auth variables return `503`, never public app data.
- Authenticated request returns the app HTML.
- HTTPS is active.
- Browser refresh and direct routes load the SPA.
- Static assets load behind auth.
- No `localhost` URLs are present in built client assets.
- Real YomYom data is visible.
- Phone QA passes on a real phone.
- Tablet QA passes on a real tablet.
- Rollback is tested with `vercel rollback <deployment-url-or-id>`.

## Custom Domain

Use the default Vercel deployment URL until the DNS owner confirms a custom subdomain. Do not point
customer traffic at an unprotected or unverified domain.
